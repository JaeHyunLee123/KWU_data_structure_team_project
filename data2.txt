Nowadays most of computer devices are based on Von Neuman structure.
As we know, Von Neuman structure shows impressive performance and reliability therefore, many people trust this structure and use it widely.
In Von Neuman structure, CPU and memory device are separated and they should use a lot of resources and time to communicate with each other.
Because of this, computers need additional resources for communication between CPU and memory device.
Therefore, we decide to develop a neuromorphic chip and start our business with the neuromorphic chip.
Neuromorphic chips are next generation chips which mimic structure and operation of human brain.
As memory neurons and computation neurons are not strictly separated in human brains,
CPU and memory device are not separated like Von Neuman structure in neuromorphic chips.
CPU and memory are combined in neuromorphic chips.
thus, neuromorphic chips can save computation result simultaneously without additional sequences.
Because of this characteristic, neuromorphic chips can save more resources than Von Neuman based devices and show fast computational speed.
In addition, using neuromorphic chips, we can use Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in hardware.
ANN is key technology for Artificial Intelligent (AI) and
it is only implemented with software in large Von Neuman devices such as high-performance server.
However, with neuromorphic chips, ANN can be implemented with small hardware and donâ€™t need a lot of resources like conventional servers.
So, we can develop small and energy efficient AI devices with neuromorphic chips and use it for many portable devices such as smartphones and laptops.
As we can see the benefits and probability of neuromorphic chips,
our neuromorphic chip can be a good substitute of Von Neuman device and an important device for ANN and AI.
