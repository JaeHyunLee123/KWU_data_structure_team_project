The goal of carring out neuromorphic chips is to enable them to learn as quickly and efficiently as the human brain, that is now far superior to
the most powerfull computers.
Neuromorphic computing is expected to be easier to develop and innovatively apply intelligence and automation in the field in a variety of AI edge
devices and applications which require continuous learning and adaptation to evolving real world data in real time.
The Loihi processor based on the Intel Neuromorphic chip gets inspiration from human brain. Like brain, Royhey can handle specific
workloads which are up to 1,000 times faster and 10,000 times more efficient than traditional processors. Intel also announced in March
Pohoiki Springs, the newest and most powerful neuromorphic research system that provides the computational power of 100 million neurons
PoHoyiki Springs operates at a power level of less than 500 watts and extends the Royhi Neuromorphic Research Chip, Intel's first
self-learning chip that combines neuromorphic capabilities, efficiency, scale, and on-chip learning capabilities by more than 750
times. Especially, PoHoyki Springs is a Data Center Rack-Mounted System, it is Intel’s largest neuromorphic computing system developed
until today, and 768 Royhi neuromorphic research chips have been integrated within a chassis of give standard servers.
- Future semiconductors with the most efficient human brain.
The " neuromorphic chip" is semiconductor that imitates the nervous system that compose the human brain. As can be seen from the compound words of
neuron and morphic, it’s applied to semiconductors by imitating neurons and synapses that compose human brain nerves, so it can
efficiently handle unstructured signals and a lot of data at once with high energy efficiency.
