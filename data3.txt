In conventional Von Neuman devices, CPU does not have enough storages to save data, therefore it communicates with memory and saves data in it.
Moreover, memory can’t remember data without power, it needs auxiliary memory devices such as hard disc and Solid-State Disk (SSD).
Many energies are used for these devices to communicate each other, and this point makes Von Neuman devices have low energy efficiency.
We try to solve this problem and provide energy efficient neuromorphic chips for computers.
Nowadays, we can use many AI services based on ANN and these services show impressive performance.
ANN mimics human’s brain like neuromorphic chips.
However, it is only implemented with software in high performance servers which consume a lot of energy.
In other words, we use ANN with inefficient environment, and we can’t maximize benefits of ANN.
Because of this, ANN is now only used with big and fast devices such as workstations and servers.
People who don’t have high performance devices can’t use ANN properly.
Neuromorphic devices are optimized for ANN, and it allows ANN to be used in small and portable devices.
Therefore, accessibility of ANN can be improved, and more people can use and apply ANN to many fields.
Conventional devices based on Von Neuman structure have energy efficient problem and optimization problem with ANN.
Neuromorphic chip shows high energy efficiency and compatibility with ANN. Thus, it can be a good solution for these problems.
